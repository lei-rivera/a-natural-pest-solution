            <hr>
            <p>
                Stinging insects such as wasps, hornets and yellowjackets can pose serious risks—especially to people who are allergic—and can disrupt outdoor living and business activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yellowjackets (for example species of the genera Vespula spp.) are social wasps that often cause stinging problems in late summer and fall when food is scarce and colonies are large. They are frequently mistaken for bees but differ in appearance and behaviour. Because their colonies can include many workers and they scavenge sweet foods and meats, they pose particular risk when outdoor activities or trash containers are present.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hornets and paper wasps (for example the “bald-faced hornet” and other species) also build social nests and can sting multiple times. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) places these under “Wasps” in its bees/wasps guidance. Paper-wasp nests often hang from eaves or overhangs, among other places.
            </p>
            <p>
                At A Natural Pest Solution, we provide safe, effective, and environmentally-aware services for managing these insects around homes and businesses in Joliet and the surrounding region. Our goal is to remove or safely manage nests, and help prevent re-infestations, all while using approaches that minimise risk to your family, pets and the environment.
            </p>
