            <!-- Paragraphs -->
            <p>
                Stinging insects are a common concern for Illinois homeowners, especially during spring and summer when colonies reach their peak size. Wasps, hornets, and yellowjackets can build nests near homes, decks, or landscaping, creating risks for stings and aggressive behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paper wasps are slender insects with long legs that hang down during flight. They typically appear brown with yellow or reddish markings. Their open, umbrella-shaped nests are commonly found under roof overhangs, eaves, and porch ceilings. According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, paper wasps are generally less aggressive than yellowjackets but will defend their nest if disturbed. Their stings can cause pain, swelling, or allergic reactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yellowjackets are small, fast-moving wasps with bright yellow and black coloration. They typically nest in the ground, wall voids, landscaping, or abandoned rodent burrows. Yellowjackets are among the most aggressive stinging insects in Illinois. According to IDPH and multiple Extension programs, they are strongly attracted to human food and become more aggressive in late summer as natural food sources decline. Their stings can be severe and may trigger allergic responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bald-faced hornets, a common species in Illinois, are actually a type of large yellowjacket. They have black-and-white coloration, large bodies, and build large football-shaped paper nests in trees, shrubs, or on buildings. Hornets are highly protective of their nests. The University of Illinois Extension notes that these insects can sting repeatedly and may become aggressive when nests are approached. Their nests often grow very large by late summer, increasing risk to people or pets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stinging insect nests can contain hundreds to thousands of aggressive workers by late summer. Attempting DIY removal is dangerous and often ineffective.
