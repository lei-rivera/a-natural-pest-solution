            <p>
                Rodents are not just a nuisance — they can cause property damage and pose health risks. At A Natural Pest Solution, we provide safe, effective, and environmentally-aware rodent-control services for homes and businesses in Joliet and the surrounding region. Our aim is to remove infestations quickly and help prevent their return — all while using methods that are safe for families, pets, and the environment.
            </p>

                The common house mouse can squeeze through very small openings, find food and shelter in buildings, and reproduce rapidly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Norway rat (also known as the brown rat or sewer rat) is a larger, more destructive rodent. The IDPH describes them as “destructive pests … [that] eat and contaminate food, damage buildings and other property by their gnawing and burrowing, and may spread diseases that affect people and pets.” They can exploit openings as small as ½ inch across to enter structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                While voles are primarily outdoor rodents and less likely to invade buildings, they can cause serious damage to lawns, gardens, and landscapes. The University of Illinois Extension states that voles “can cause serious damage and even death of woody plants” and create tunnels or runways often under snow.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've seen droppings, heard scratching in walls or ceilings, noticed tunnels around landscaping, or simply suspect rodent activity, don't delay. Rats and mice can reproduce quickly, and voles can silently damage landscapes.
