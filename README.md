# A Natural Pest Solution — Website  

This is a landing webpage I built for a local pest control company in Illinois and is my first professional project. The website features the company's expertise and contact information.

## How It's Made

**Features**: The website showcases the company's values, local roots, and expertise. There are detailed sections showcasing different kinds of pest problems with links to subpages that go more into depth about rodents, wasps, or other insects. Each subpage has a 'call today' button that opens up the user's phone app, and there is a contact form at the bottom of the page that sends customer inqueries to the company's email

**Tech used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla), and Krita (design)

I played around with the Hyperspace template from html5up.net, adjusting pictures and colors and whatnot (that is what is in the mockup/ folder in previous commits). Once I had a design 'mockup' that I liked and the client approved of, I rebuilt the design myself with original code. At this point I only really know HTML and CSS, but I was able to figure out how to get the design of the navigation bar to work using JavaScript. I do have a bit of a design background myself and so I manually converted the PNG file I was given of the logo into an SVG file used on the website.

## Lessons Learned

While I already knew quite a lot about HTML and CSS, building an actual project, especially a freelance one for a client, taught me a lot about what goes into building websites and being a developer. I got to learn a lot about responsive design and developing with basic accessibility in mind. This project really put my problem solving skills to the test, especially since you get no error-codes telling you why your image is overflowing outside of its div container. I had to mess around with the code and figure out why things weren't working the way I wanted to. The most challenging part was figuring out how to have the navigation bar design change based on what part of the website the viewport was on. I know how to program but as of this moment, I didn't know any javascript syntax, so it really tested my resourcefulness in figuring out how to program the design I had in mind without using AI to do the work for me. The biggest lesson this first project taught me though is that, as a developer, when you think you're done, there's always something new that pops up.
